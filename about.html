     <p class="bodyParagraph">The dark days were a time of difficulty and misery for the people in the earliest Aotearoa tales. The people of the land no time to do their daily activities and enjoy the pleasures of life because of the sun's rapid pace across the sky. Due to the short amount of daylight, Maori people were forced to fulfil their tasks in a perpetual race against the clock.
      The land was enveloped in a feeling of urgency and unrest during these gloomy days. The sun's quick ascent left people with only a few brief seconds to secure their food, thus fishing, hunting, and gathering food became rushed activities. Maui was not happy and decided he must take matters into his own hands and prolong the length of the days. </p>

   <p class="bodyParagraph">With a group of one hundred men, Maui set off on his quest. He set out to control the sun's erratic course across the skies, armed with strong flax ropes and unflinching resolve. Maui lassoed the sun's ferocious rays, using his incredible strength to cause the blazing orb to slow down. In order to get the sun to obey, he even threatened to cut off its legs. The sun pleaded with Maui for pity as he faced his strength and tenacity, vowing to traverse across the sky slower. Form then on the poeple of the land  had plenty of time to carry out their everyday activities thanks. The longer daylight hours allowed the people to pursue their interests and grow their livelihoods.</p>

The story encourages us to overcome issues ingeniously in a world filled with difficulties. It exhorts embracing challenges as opportunities for development and harnessing the power of the human spirit to achieve greatness.
