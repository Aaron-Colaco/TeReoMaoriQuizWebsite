  <p class= "quote">"I ia ra me oma tatou ki te mahi i a tatou mahi me te kohi kai i mua i te torengitanga o te ra. He aha tatou hei taurekareka ma te ra?"</p>
  <p class="bodyParagraph">The dark days were a time of difficulty and misery for the people in the earliest Aotearoa tales. The people of the land no time to do their daily activities and enjoy the pleasures of life because of the sun's rapid pace across the sky. Due to the short amount of daylight, Maori people were forced to fulfil their tasks in a perpetual race against the clock.
    The land was enveloped in a feeling of urgency and unrest during these gloomy days. The sun's quick ascent left people with only a few brief seconds to secure their food, thus fishing, hunting, and gathering food became rushed activities. Maui was not happy and decided he must take matters into his own hands and prolong the length of the days.
